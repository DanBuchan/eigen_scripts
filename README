run_dssp.py - run dssp over a dir of pdb files : DEPRECATED

1) run_strsum_eigen.py - runs the eigengthreader tdb generator over a db of pdb and dssp files
                      Uses the HHSearch_overlap dir as the sourcece of which
                      files to generate
2) equalise_fold_libs.py - read the HHSeach lib and delete anything that isn't
                           in the et_data lib

4) run_blast.py - runs blastp over a dir of fasta files


Sorting the fold libs:


Removing homologues from fold libs:
3) extract_fasta.py - extracts the fasta files from the HHSearch hhms
                   hhsearch.fasta
5) remove_homolgues.py - removes the homologues from the fold libs found in the blast run
6) find_homologues.py - read the scop classification and identify the SCOP
                     structural homologues for the PSICOV benchmark set
                     pdb_scop_class.txt: pdb Domain ID to SCOP class for ALL
                                         classified pdb chains
                     scop_class_members.txt: SCOP class to a list of domains
                                             included in that class
                     scop_superfamil_members.txt: SCOP superfamily to list of
                                                  domain ids
                     non_redundant_list.txt: A list of all the benchmark pdb
                                             ids AND ids of their immediate
                                             homologues
                     non_redundant_list_superfamily.txt: as above but
                                                        superfamily members
                     benchmark_family_members.txt : scop family members for the

                     benchmark_superfamily_members.txt :
                     benchmark_domain_id.txt : scop domain IDS for the benchmark
                                              set

7) run_eigen_threader_morecambe.py: run it changing the t value from 1 to 20 (c=10)
8) run_eigen_threader_morecambe.py: run it changing the c value from 1 to 20 (t=20)
9) Walkthrough HHSearch_build.txt instructions, to generate the HHSearch comparison data
10) then run genthreader with the et_reduced lib run_genthreader.py. Edit GenThreader.sh
for the fold lib and list

Process benchmark data:
11) count_eigenvector_benchmark.py - Takes the eigen_vector benchmark data and
                                 outputs the t1, t2, t5 and t10 performances
                                 (skipping the immediate structural homologues
                                 as given by SCOP), t and c values changed by editing
12) count_performance.py- work out the t1,t2,t5 and t10 performance for graphing.
                      c and t values changed by editing
13) draw_benchmark_performance_graph.R - takes the eigenvector performance numbers
                                     and the distance numbers and plots some
                                     graphs

Check graphs and then run optimised eigenthreader!!!!

14) count_comparison_perfomance.py - takes the genth, hhsearch and optimal eig
                                 and outputs the best 10 results for each method
                                 see /processed_comparison
15) sum_comparison_performance.py - work out the t1,t2,t5 and t10 performance
                                  for each method

16) count_gdt_perfomance.py - takes the genth, hhsearch and optimal eig models and
                            calculates the modelling performance

17) draw_comparison.R - create barchart of the fold recognition comparison performance

### AND THERE'S MORE

18) subset_contacts.py - takes the metapsicov contact files and outputs
L/2, L/5, L/10 subsets for top and random subsets for long range contacts
separation > 21 residues
19) run_eigen_threader.py - takes the query input files and outputs
an eigenthreader prediction, edited to take the subset contacts and output
to an appropriate subset output dir
20) count_eigenvector_benchmark.py : change the path to the .out files
