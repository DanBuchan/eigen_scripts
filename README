run_dssp.py - run dssp over a dir of pdb files : DEPRECATED
run_strsum_eigen.py - runs the eigengthreader tdb generator over a db of pdb and dssp files
                      Uses the HHSearch_overlap dir as the source of which
                      files to generate
run_blast.py - runs blastp over a dir of fasta files


Sorting the fold libs:
diff_chains_list.py - takes list of db files for each method and outputs a file
                      indicating which pdbs are in all the libraries
                      joint_chains.txt
sort_structure_libs.py - takes the list of unified pdbs and moves the files to
                         the union/overlapping fold recognition dbs


Removing homologues from fold libs:
extract_fasta.py - extracts the fasta files from the HHSearch pdbs
                   hhsearch.fasta
remove_homolgues.py - removes the homologues from the fold libs found in the blast run
find_homologues.py - read the scop classification and identify the SCOP
                     structural homologues for the PSICOV benchmark set

                     scop_class_members.txt: SCOP class to a list of domains
                                             included in that class
                     scop_superfamil_members.txt: SCOP superfamily to list of

                     non_redundant_list.txt: A list of all the benchmark pdb
                                             ids AND ids of their immediate
                                             homologues
                     non_redundant_list_superfamily.txt: as above but
                                                        superfamily members
                     benchmark_family_members.txt : scop family members for the

                     benchmark_superfamily_members.txt :
                     benchmark_domain_id.txt : scop domain IDS for the benchmark
                                              set
Process benchmark data:
count_eigenvector_benchmark.py - Takes the eigen_vector benchmark data and
                                 outputs the t1, t2, t5 and t10 performances
                                 (skipping the immediate structural homologues
                                 as given by SCOP)
count_performance.py - work out the t1,t2,t5 and t10 performance for graphing.

draw_benchmark_performance_graph.R - takes the eigenvector performance numbers
                                     and the distance numbers and plots some
                                     graphs

count_comparison_perfomance.py - takes the genth, hhsearch and optimal eig
                                 and outputs the best 10 results for each method
                                 see /processed_comparison
sum_comparison_performance.py - work out the t1,t2,t5 and t10 performance
                                  for each method

* count_gdt_perfomance.py - takes the genth, hhsearch and optimal eig models and
                            calculates the modelling performance
