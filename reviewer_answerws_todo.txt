X 1) Switch to ECOD seems redudant to this paper

* 2) Change HHSearch to profile-profile search?
X 3) As explained we find hits for most but our filtering procedure, to
simulate analagous fold recognition eliminates most hits.
* 4) add realign option
X 5) Comparison to fragfold or confold? Redundant as we're not benchmarking
a protein folding methodology

Rev2
X 1) Comparison to AL-eigen? Reviewer is mistaken that eigenTHREADER is
more accurate that AL-eigen, speed increase is at a minor accuracy cost.

Rev3
X 1) Pfam families? 150 single domain proteins from the PSICOV benchmark
We accept that typically a sequence search would find homologues and these
can be used for homology modelling in the typicaly case. The paper attempts
to simulate the case where our 150 proteins fail to find sequence homologues.

We wish to stick with the 150 single domain proteins, rather than generate
a new CASP based benchmarks, as they these are a well understood and
accepted benchmark dataset in contact fold predcition and we understand they
produce high quality contact maps when used with contemporary contact prediction
methods (PSICOV etc..)
X 2) Assessment at superfamily level, redundant as it's not what the paper is about
X 3) We can not use a min or max score in cases where there are no valid hits
(as per our filtering criteria)


BING 1) Cite paper as requested
X 2) Compare with other threading methods, seems redundant. HHSearch and pGenTHREADER
were chosen as representative of known high preforming threader and homology
search methods. The paper isn't a benchmark of threading methods in general.
